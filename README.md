# Reservation Page

This is a reservation page for a hotel with date validation.

This is an activity from the technical course in systems development at Senai.

Create an HTML page where the user must input the number of people, which must be at least 2, and the date cannot be before today's date. If either validation is not met, a message should appear informing the user about the issue.

**Instructions:**

- Input the number of people (minimum of 2).
- Select a date (not before today's date).

If any of the validations fail, an error message will be displayed to the user.
